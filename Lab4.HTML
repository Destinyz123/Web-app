                    5th of November<br>
When I walked you home<br>
That's when I nearly said it<br>
But then said "Forget it" and froze<br>
Do you remember?<br>
You probably don't<br>
'Cause the sparks in the sky<br>
Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke<br>
<br>
Yesterday, drank way too much<br>
And stayed up too late<br>
Started to write but I wanna say<br>
Deleted the message, but I still remember it said<br>
<br>
I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight<br>
Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3<br>
And you can't fall asleep<br>
Waiting for me to reply<br>
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by<br>
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open<br>
Instead of just hoping<br>
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside<br>
<br>
